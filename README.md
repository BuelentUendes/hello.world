# hello.world
This is just a short test for me to get used to creating repositories.

Hi,

My name is Buelent and I just get started with my new degree in Data Science. Ever since I started my first masters degree in Economics, I became more interested in that new and very fascinated academic field. So after completing my masters in Lund, I thought of taking a new challenge and start my new degree in Barcelona at the Graduate School of Economics.
